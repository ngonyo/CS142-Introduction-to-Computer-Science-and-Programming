Problem:
	Create a program that prompts the user to enter a word that is less than 100 characters. The program then displays/outputs the word they entered. It will continue asking them to enter a word until they opt to end the program by inputting N at the menu. Tell the user they have entered an invalid input if they dont choose Y or N at menu.

Input:
	User choosen word.
	User's choice to either continue or not

Output:
	Welcome to program.
	Prompt to enter a word less than 100 characters
	User's input backwards
	Menu asking user if they want to continue (loop)
	Error message if they dont enter Y or N
	Thank user for using program.

Step By Step Solution:
	Declare / Define functions
		If length / size of word entered is less than 2 (1) return word to user. Otherwise store each character in string (array) and value swap with word/input.
	Init. variables int size, char input[size]
	char select
	Welcome user to program
	Create looping menu asking user if they want to continue
	If they select N, output thank you, goodbye.
	If they select Y, keep running program.
