Problem:
	Create a program that asks the user to input dimensions for the following shapes: a Square, Rectangle, and Triangle.
	Take the square dimensions and calculate area using (x^2)
	Take the rectangle dimensions and calculate area using (x*y)
	Take the triangle dimensions and calculate area using (.5*x*y)
	Print areas of each of the shapes based on inputs given.

Input:
	User's square dimensions (length) (integer)
	User's rectangle dimensions (length, height) (integers)
	User's triangle dimensions (length, height) (integers)

Output
	Area of square based on user's input
	Area of rectangle based on user's input
	Area of triangle based on user's input

Step-by-Step Solution:

	1. Welcome the user to my program.

	2. Prompt the user to enter length of square
	3. Store the user entered number into a variable of type integer

	4. Prompt the user to enter length and height of rectangle
	5. Store the user entered numbers into 2 variables of type integer

	6. Prompt the user to enter length and height of triangle
	7. Store the user entered numbers into 2 variables of type integer

	8. Take length of square and perform function x^2
	9. Take length and height of rectangle and perform function (x*y)
	10. Take length and height of triangle and perform function (.5*x*y)
	
	9. Display the area of square
	10. Display the area of rectangle
	11. Display the area of triangle
	12. Terminate the program.
